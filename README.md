# FAQ Chatbot â€“ AI-Powered Hybrid Search Assistant

An AI-powered chatbot that answers questions using a preloaded FAQ dataset.
It combines dense embeddings + sparse BM25 + reranking to give accurate answers from your FAQs.

# Key Features

* Ask any question from your FAQ dataset
* Hybrid search: dense embeddings + sparse BM25 for better results
* Reranks results with CrossEncoder for high accuracy
* Supports conversational context (last 3 messages)
* Built with LangChain LLMs (Ollama)

# How It Works

1. Load FAQs from `faqs.json`
2. Encode FAQs using:

   * Dense embeddings (HuggingFace)
   * Sparse embeddings (BM25)
3. Upload embeddings to Pinecone for hybrid search
4. When a question is asked:

   * Hybrid search retrieves relevant FAQs
   * Reranker ranks them
   * LLM generates the final answer using top results and recent conversation
